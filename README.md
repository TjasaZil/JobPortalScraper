# Job Portal Scraper

**Goal:** Make a job portal (HTML | CSS | TS) where user can input a job title, check what platforms they want to search on and the website scrapes the data and returns it in an organized manner with links to the original listing.

## Project setup

- clone repo
- run **npm install** to install node modules
- run **npm run build** to compile typescript. JS files will be available in the dist file after that
- run **npm install -g typescript**
- go to src file and run **tsc index.ts**

## Technologies used:

- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/docs/intro)
- [axios](https://axios-http.com/)

## To Do:

1. Set Up Development Environment:

- [x] Install necessary dependencies like TypeScript, Cheerio, and Axios.
- [x] Configure project structure and folders.

2. Define Project Architecture:

- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for data structures (e.g., job listings, platform options).
- [ ] Establish initial data flow between components.

3. Implement Scraping Functionality:

- [ ] Utilize Cheerio to extract job listings from selected platforms.
- [ ] Integrate Axios for making HTTP requests to job portal websites.
- [ ] Test scraping functionality thoroughly to ensure accurate extraction of job listings and relevant details.

4. User Interface Development:

- [ ] Design and develop user interface components for inputting job title and selecting platforms.
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for seamless user experience across different devices.

5. Error Handling and Robustness:

- [ ] Set up error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected issues during scraping (e.g., network errors, invalid HTML structures).
- [ ] Test error handling functionality to ensure robustness and reliability.

6. Optimization and Refinement:

- [ ] Refine scraping logic to optimize performance and accuracy.
- [ ] Address edge cases and handle exceptions gracefully to prevent disruptions in the scraping process.

7. Documentation:

- [ ] Document the scraping process, data extraction methods, and error handling mechanisms for future reference and maintenance.
- [ ] Update README.md with project description, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

8. Testing and Quality Assurance:

- [ ] Conduct thorough testing of the application to identify and address any bugs or issues.
- [ ] Collaborate with QA team to ensure comprehensive testing coverage and reliability.

9. Code Review and Feedback:

- [ ] Prepare for code review and gather feedback from the team on implemented functionality.
- [ ] Address any suggestions or improvements identified during code review.

10. Deployment and Release:

- [ ] Deploy the application to a staging environment for further testing and validation.
- [ ] Coordinate with stakeholders for final approval and release to production environment.

11. Maintenance and Support:

- [ ] Monitor application performance and user feedback post-release.
- [ ] Provide ongoing maintenance and support as needed, addressing any issues or enhancements.

12. Continuous Improvement:

- [ ] Collect feedback from users and stakeholders for future enhancements.
- [ ] Plan and prioritize additional features or improvements based on feedback and project goals.
